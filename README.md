# ScaledNumbersInput

Provides the `@SI` macro for converting numbers with SI prefixes

## Examples

```julia
julia> @SI 4.5T
4.5e12

julia> @SI values = [1.2n, 100a, 5.7G]
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.2e-9
 1.0e-16
 5.7e9

```

## Supported Scaling Factors

The following scaling factors are recognized:

| Scaling Symbol | Factor |
|:--------------:| ------:|
| Y              | 1e24   |
| Z              | 1e21   |
| E              | 1e18   |
| P              | 1e15   |
| T              | 1e12   |
| G              | 1e9    |
| M              | 1e6    |
| K              | 1e3    |
| k              | 1e3    |
| m              | 1e-3   |
| u              | 1e-6   |
| Î¼              | 1e-6   |
| n              | 1e-9   |
| p              | 1e-12  |
| f              | 1e-15  |
| a              | 1e-18  |
| z              | 1e-21  |
| y              | 1e-24  |

## Why not just define constants like `const M=1000000`?

That was considered but it has two downsides

### 1. Lower accuracy

For example, compare:

```
julia> @SI 100a
1.0e-16

julia> const a = 1e-18
1.0e-18

julia> 100a
1.0000000000000001e-16
```

As you can see the `100 * 1e-18` has worse accuracy.

### 2. Namespace pollution

The other downside of defining constants
for the scaling factors is it uses a lot of
single character variables.
With `@SI` it reads a block in and
only converts expressions with a literal number
followed by an SI scaling factor.  For example:

```jldoctest
julia> function f(k)
          c1 = k + 2k
          c2 = @SI k + 2k
          return (c1=c1, c2=c2)
       end
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(10)
(c1 = 30, c2 = 2010.0)

```

Note that for `c2` the `k` in `2k` was interpreted as 2*1e3 while the preceeding `k` was not.  If `const k = 1000` was defined at
the top level then the argument `k` would take
precedence and `k` scalings inside `f` would
not work.
